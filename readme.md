This is a repo containing all the work for tensorflow specialisation on coursera provided by deeplearning.ai
## Course 1 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

Started with the introduction to simple Neural Network implemented using TensorFlow <br>
a.First practical implemented through housing price prediction <br>
b.Second handwritten recognition using callback function with the epochs terminating at set accuracy termination after the epoch is completed. <br>
c.Improving the accuracy and precision for a dataset using Convolutional layer and single max pooling.<br>
&nbsp 1. Convolutions are a way to extract particular features from a image. Technically, A convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in an activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in an input, such as an image.
&nbsp 2. Pooling layers are placed immediately after CNN declaration. It takes the input from the user as a feature map which comes out convolutional networks and prepares a condensed feature map. Pooling layers help in creating layers with neurons of previous layers.
